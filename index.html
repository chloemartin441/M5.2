            <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
            <p>By Evan Wild</p>
            <p>
                Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.
            </p>
            <p>
                So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of bear</h3>
            <p>
                Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behaviour, as you'll find out below.
            </p>

            <caption>The table above shows various characteristics of bears both in the wild and urban enviorments, including the coat color, the size an adult reaches, the habitat they live in, they typical lifespan and diet.</caption>

            <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
            <p>
                Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. In general, they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their sustenance from farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
            </p>

            <p>
                Urban bears, on the other hand, have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other urban creatures if necessary, but prefer to scavenge from urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints.

            <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
            <p>
                Bears are romantic creatures by nature and will look for a mate to spend the rest of their lives with. They woo potential suitors with elaborate displays, such as decorating their dwellings.
