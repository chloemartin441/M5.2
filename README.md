# 5.2 Lab

## Overview

For this project students were tasked to alter a website so that it meets accessibility standards. This was done by changing things such as color, providing transcripts of audio links, etc. 

## Accessibility Lab Answers
Color: According to the WCAG the color scheme must meet a certain ratio to be accessible. For the header, using a dark blue color the ratio is 7.2:1 which meets the requirments. The nav section also passes with a ratio of 21:1. The article background passes vs the paragraphs with a ratio of 12.6:1. Finally, the second background and links also passes with 4.5:1.

Semantic HTML: The menu is wrapped in the <nav> element which meets the requirment of this project. A user can also use this site only using keyboard navigation. There are many headers to make it easier to read along with the images and audio having a description. 

Images: The images now also include a description to make it easeir. 
Audio: There is a description of the audio and also an option to download the audio file for older browsers.

Input: I used a visually hidden lable so screen readers can read but it won't impact those who use their sight. 

Table: There is a description of the table along with color contrast to make it easier to read and see. 

Other ways: Error messaging might be helpful, when the forms are submitted in the wrong way a clear message of what occured may be useful. Along with this, I could use ARIA live to inform the screen readers of changes without having them refresh the page.
